## All Scripts
When this page is loaded, it should have a collapsed "Filter" area at the top of the page, and then display a list of scripts, probably by default sorted alphabetically by script name. I'm thinking the fields for the display should be:
* Script Name
* Author (with link to profile, if known)
* Uploader (with link to profile)
* Teensy (Y/N)

The list shouldn't make the page scroll, instead it should only display about 15 scripts per page, and then have buttons to change pages at the bottom of the list.
