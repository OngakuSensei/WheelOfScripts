## All Scripts
When this page is loaded, it should have a collapsed "Filter" area at the top of the page, and then display a list of scripts, probably by default sorted alphabetically by script name. I'm thinking the fields for the display should be:
* Script Name
* Author (with link to profile, if known)
* Uploader (with link to profile)
* Teensy (Y/N)

The list shouldn't make the page scroll, instead it should only display about 15 scripts per page, and then have buttons to change pages at the bottom of the list.
### Filter
* Full Only/Full + Teensy/Teensy Only
* Exclude Duplicates *(If two scripts have the exact same character list, this will only display the earliest-uploaded one in the list)*
* Characters To Include *(I'm picturing one of those fields where you can start typing a thing, it finds the full things that match them, and when you click it or press enter, it makes a little "object" of that thing in the box, and then you can keep typing, same for excluded characters)*
* Characters to Exclude
* Script Author *(text, maybe with suggestions as people type?)*
