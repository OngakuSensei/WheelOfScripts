## Script Upload/Edit Page
The upload/edit page will basically be the same, except that the edit page will come pre-filled with all of the current script's info and only the upload field will be left blank.
* Script Title
* A checkbox to indicate that the uploader is NOT the author, in which case a text box appears for them to specify the author
* Description of the Script
* json upload.

**Notes: Editing a script should only make a new version if any characters changed from the previous version. If only the description was updated, it should not count as a new version, and the Title/Author/Uploader fields will not be editable.
