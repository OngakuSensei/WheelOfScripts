## Homebrew Script DB
* Script ID *(An integer with the letter H in front of it)*
* Script Uploader *(User ID)*

* Submitted to Public *(Y/N)*
* Added to Public wheel *(Y/N)*
* Teensy *(Auto-detected, determines whether the script is for a full game or for teensy)*

* Full Json Text *(This is just the full text of the uploaded json for parsing later)*
* Fabled List *(csv list of Fabled)*
